# 🦆 Rubber Duck Tarot Tweet Generator

> Content generation system for Rob, a dead developer trapped in a rubber duck who gives life advice through perspective cards.

## The Problem

Building a consistent brand voice on social media while creating engaging daily content is brutally hard. Most founders either:
- Burn out writing tweets manually every day
- Resort to generic motivational quotes that sound like everyone else
- Hire expensive social media managers who don't understand the product

## The Solution

**Structured card database + AI prompt engineering = infinite branded content**

This system generates "Rob's Fortune Cookie" tweets using:
- 36 perspective cards based on modern life debugging scenarios
- Character-driven AI prompts that maintain Rob's sarcastic-but-helpful voice
- Targeted messaging for different audiences (developers, creatives, professionals)

## How It Works

### 1. Card Database
Each card contains:
```json
{
  "name": "Airplane",
  "emoji": "✈️", 
  "duck_question": "What needs to change location?",
  "duck_wisdom": "You're trying to fix something in the wrong environment entirely...",
  "block_applications": {
    "work": "That toxic team isn't going to magically improve...",
    "creative": "Stop forcing creativity in the same environment...",
    "life": "You're optimizing a situation that fundamentally doesn't work..."
  }
}
```

### 2. AI Prompt Engineering
Custom GPT instructions that:
- Maintain Rob's consistent voice (dead developer, anti-hustle, practical)
- Target specific audiences using block applications
- Generate engagement-driving questions
- Keep fortune cookie format for shareability

### 3. Content Output
```
🥠 Rob's Fortune Cookie:
*"That toxic team, outdated tech stack, or dead-end role isn't going to magically improve. Sometimes the best debugging is a clean migration to something better."*
**What are you trying to fix that would be better off relocated entirely?**
```

## Sample Generated Tweets

### For Developers
🥠 Rob's Fortune Cookie:
*"You're spending more time maintaining dead weight than building new momentum. That function hasn't been called in months - just delete it."*
**What are you keeping alive that should have been killed months ago?**

### For Creatives  
🥠 Rob's Fortune Cookie:
*"You're researching inspiration instead of creating. Stop searching for the perfect reference and start making something."*
**What are you collecting instead of using?**

### For General Audience
🥠 Rob's Fortune Cookie:
*"You're trying to optimize your entire system when you just need to fix the immediate resource problem. Handle your actual needs first."*
**What basic need are you ignoring while chasing complex solutions?**

## The Character: Rob

Rob is a dead software developer who:
- Died avoiding a startup pitch deck at a Halloween party
- Got trapped in a rubber duck wearing a wizard hat
- Spent 25 years optimizing other people's dreams while his own projects collected dust
- Now helps the living debug their life decisions from beyond the grave

**Voice:** Sarcastic but genuinely helpful, anti-hustle culture, practical debugging wisdom with developer metaphors.

## Use Cases

### Product Founders
- Generate consistent branded content without hiring expensive social media managers
- Maintain character voice across all platforms
- Target different audience segments with same core message

### Content Creators
- Systematic approach to daily content creation
- Audience engagement through reframe questions
- Escape the "what should I post today?" paralysis

### AI Practitioners  
- Example of effective prompt engineering for character consistency
- Structured data approach to content generation
- Balance between automation and authentic voice

## Getting Started

1. **Set up Custom GPT** using instructions in `/prompts/fortune-cookie.md`
2. **Upload cards.json** as knowledge base
3. **Test with sample prompts** from `/examples/`
4. **Customize for your brand** using the card structure as template

## Why Open Source This?

Building in public, sharing what works, helping other founders solve the content creation problem. The real value is in the product (Rubber Duck Tarot), not the tweet generator.

Plus, Rob would want his debugging wisdom to help as many people as possible. It's what he would have done if he hadn't died avoiding that pitch deck.
